# RollingDrop Architecture Foundation
## Core System Design & Principles

### System Overview
RollingDrop is a high-scale mystery box platform designed to handle 50M+ daily transactions across B2B and B2C channels. The architecture prioritizes scalability, reliability, and real-time performance.

---

## 1. Architectural Principles

### 1.1 Design Philosophy
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Services organized around business domains
- **Event-First Architecture**: All state changes emit events for consistency
- **API-First Design**: Every feature accessible via well-defined APIs
- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for Kubernetes and horizontal scaling
- **Security by Design**: Zero-trust model with encryption everywhere

### 1.2 Core Principles
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling to handle traffic spikes
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times for critical operations
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency with strong consistency where needed
- **Observability**: Full tracing, metrics, and logging across all services
